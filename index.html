	           <p>I'm a big music fan. It seems to me that every kind of musical production is worth listening to, that is the reason why my playlists are always made of so many different type of songs, from techno to Gregorian choirs! </p>

               <p>I passed French Baccalauréat in 2019, with Highest Honnors, and then made it to a great "classe prépa" in Rennes, called Lycée Chateaubriand. I spent two memorable years there, along with my best friends in the boarding school. Now I'm super happy to start my second year here at HEC Paris</p>
